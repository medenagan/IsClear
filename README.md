An experimental  **didactic project** for scraping Instagram users and unfollowing who doesn't follow back.

## An extension to scrape and unfollow users who doesn't follow you back on Instagram

This is a just an educational project and it's not intended to be used in any real application.


The scope of this extension is to explore the **potentiality of the Chromium extension API**.

As a toy example for the webRequest API, **this extension scrapes user's own followers and followed people, showing who doesn't follow them back**.

Also, it suggests one way to automatize some tasks in a web page. As an example, in this case, **it unfollows Instagram users who doesn't follow back**, in a batch mode.

Please note the goal is not working on Instagram accounts. This project is aimed to study and practice the Chromium extension API. 

As such, these toy examples may also be changed later, being unessential to achieve that objective.

**WARNING: Using it on real Instagram accounts to scrape data, automatize some tasks or collecting stats may be a violation of the Instagram policy and/or local regulations.**

We never used it on any real account. We only made some simulations in a few fake accounts, for the pure purpose of testing it.

As such, we highly recommend you abstaining from any attempt to automatically unfollow your non-follower users for real.

The project is released under MIT licence. So, you are responsible for whatever use you may decide to do, accordingly.

Should you use this extension for any other purpose than learning the API or practicing with it, please take into account there may be consequences for your misconduct.

You accept not to complain with us in case of Instagram ban or any other action against your account. You are clearly warned.

This being said, the code does not aim to do anything potentially harmful, at least as far as we can think.

It just shows how you can detect some of the information exchanged between a website and a server, as long as you have the privilege to access that page from your browser.

In a certain way, you become a "super" user and get the ability to really know the data of your interest that your browser has downloaded for you.

The extension also attempts to exemplify how to construct a client bot which can emulate, in this case, a manual defollowing action.

Again, we insist that these are just toy examples and there's no particular intention in applying them specifically to the Instagram account management.

**There are already a lot of commercial and free tools that help you check who has unfollowed you on Instagram**. If this is the only part you're interested in, or if you don't get any enjoyment from coding, we suggest you searching for one of these mentioned instruments instead.

**This code is at an early stage and there may be errors and bugs**. You are aware that the goal should checking the lines and improving them. Contributions and pull requests are more than welcomed.

Enjoy,
